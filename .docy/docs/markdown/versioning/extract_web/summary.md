This mermaid markdown code illustrates the general workflow for extracting and processing version information for various libraries (Astropy, Matplotlib, pvlib-python, pydicom, sqlfluff, and xarray) within the swe-bench project. Each library follows a similar pattern of importing necessary libraries or dependencies, fetching task instances, fetching version information from different sources (homepage, GitHub releases, FAQ pages, etc.), extracting and formatting version-date pairs, assigning versions to tasks based on dates, mapping these versions to task instances, and finally saving the versioned data. The subgraphs represent the specific processes for each library, highlighting the unique steps taken to extract and process version information for that library.
