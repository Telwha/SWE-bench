This diagram illustrates the interconnected steps and processes within the `make_datasets` folder of the project. It starts with initializing the benchmark environment, followed by various processes such as BM25 dataset retrieval, instance creation, text dataset creation, dataset tokenization, and utility functions. Each script contributes to the preparation and processing of datasets, ultimately leading to the creation of a text dataset that is ready for further actions, such as benchmarking or analysis. Utility functions support various steps in the process, indicating a cohesive workflow aimed at dataset preparation and processing within the project.
