It starts with extracting diffs from a given input, checks if the file is a test file, detects the file encoding, reads the file content, ingests directory contents, ingests file directory contents, repairs patches, and finally extracts a minimal patch from the given input. The process begins at \"Start\" and ends at \"End\", with decision points and operations represented as nodes in the flowchart.",
